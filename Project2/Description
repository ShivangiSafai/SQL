The Bank Management System is a database-driven application that facilitates the efficient handling of banking operations. It is designed to manage customer information, account details, transactions, and loan records in a secure and organized manner. The primary purpose of this project is to reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and ensure quick access to financial data for both bank staff and customers.

SQL is the core component of this project, as it is used for storing, managing, and retrieving all banking-related data. Customer records, account balances, and transaction histories are stored in SQL tables, ensuring structured data management. The use of SQL queries allows the system to perform operations such as creating new accounts, processing deposits and withdrawals, updating customer details, and generating account statements.

Additionally, SQL constraints and relationships help maintain data integrity by preventing duplication and enforcing valid connections between customers and their accounts. Transactions are securely recorded, ensuring that no data is lost or altered incorrectly. The database design also enables scalability, allowing the system to handle a large volume of customer and transaction data efficiently.

This project demonstrates how SQL can be effectively applied to build a reliable and secure system for managing banking operations.
