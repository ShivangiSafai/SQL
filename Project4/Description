The Alumni Management System is an advanced web-based project designed to assist college administrations in managing alumni records effectively. The primary goal of this project is to develop an online dashboard that enables seamless interaction between the institution and its alumni, fostering a stronger alumni network. It provides a structured platform where both recent graduates and older alumni can register, update, and share their professional and personal information.

This system not only stores alumni details but also supports activities such as maintaining registration records, managing training sessions, collecting registration fees, promoting job opportunities, and facilitating donations. Through the platform, alumni can actively participate in events, contribute to development programs, and stay connected with their peers and the institution. The centralized system ensures that the management can easily track alumni involvement, generate reports, and maintain transparency in records.

The project is developed using PHP for the application layer and MySQL as the backend database. MySQL plays a critical role in storing and managing large volumes of alumni data, ensuring data integrity and security. CRUD operations are used for adding new records, updating alumni profiles, retrieving data for search or reporting, and removing outdated information. Advanced SQL queries and relationships ensure efficient linking between alumni, events, donations, and job postings.

Overall, the Alumni Management System demonstrates how PHP and MySQL can be combined to create a dynamic, user-friendly, and scalable platform. It simplifies alumni record management, encourages engagement, and provides long-term benefits for both alumni and the institution.
